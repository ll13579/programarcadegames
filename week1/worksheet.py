#  Question 3: What do the following lines of code output?

print(2 / 3)
print(2 // 3)
#//rounds down to the nearest integer

# Question 4:

pi = 3.14159

# Question 5:

A = 22
print (A)
# the a needs to be capitalised

# Question 6:

area_of_rectangle = 10

# Question 7:

# Question 8:

a = 45
print(a)
#the value has to go before the 'print' statement

# Question 9:

pi = int(3.14)
#variable must be defined before we can 'float' it

# Question 10:
radius = float(input("Radius:"))
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = (pi * radius) ** 2

print(area)

# 11

radius = input("Enter the radius:")
#float isn't included

#15

#something that conturs continuously over time, doesn't change
